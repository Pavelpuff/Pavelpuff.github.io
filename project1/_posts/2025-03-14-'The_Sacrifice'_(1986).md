## 7 - 'The Sacrifice' (1986)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 7.9/10

The Sacrificeended up being the last film Tarkovsky ever directed, as he sadly passed away the same year it was released after being diagnosed with cancer following the film's production. Themovie deals with one man struggling with religionand fears of an impending nuclear war, all the while struggling to connect with friends and family who have visited him for his birthday.

Such themes are present in many films directed by Tarkovsky, andit's not surprising to watchThe Sacrificeand feel like it's quite bleak and haunting. Still, it arguably wouldn't be a Tarkovsky feature if it wasn't, and even though it's not his greatest work, it ended up being a powerful and effective final cinematic statement from the great director.
