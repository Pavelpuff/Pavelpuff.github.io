## 8 - 'The Steamroller and the Violin' (1961)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 7.4/10

Andrei Tarkovsky doesn't seem like the kind of filmmaker who'd make family movies, butThe Steamroller and the Violindemonstrated that he could. It was his final student film, and he made it one year before directing his first feature. Quality-wise, it's almost at the level that he'd reach with his theatrically released movies.

It only runs for about 45 minutes, and has a very simple premise involving a young boy who seems to do little but play the violin, until he meets and strikes up an unexpected friendship with a local steamroller driver.It's visually crisp presents a nice, well-told story, and shows that even at a young age, Tarkovsky could do a great deal with seemingly very little.
