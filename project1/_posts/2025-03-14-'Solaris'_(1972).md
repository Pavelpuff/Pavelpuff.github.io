## 4 - 'Solaris' (1972)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.0/10

Ascience-fiction movie that still holds uphalf a decade on from its release,Solarisis an impressive feat of filmmaking in every way. It follows a psychologist who's sent to a space station to assist the people who live there, as it's been reported that all of them seem to be suffering from some sort of psychological condition, with its origins and precise implications being a mystery.

Those who like plenty of action and excitement in their science-fiction movies may be disappointed, asSolarisis a total slow-burn from beginning to end. However, it is visually spectacular and hypnotic in parts, and for fans of the genre who don't mind something more cerebral and less explosive,Solarisis likely to be a profound watch.
