## 1 - 'Stalker' (1979)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.1/10

Stalkeris quite easily Andrei Tarkovsky's most well-knownand acclaimed film. It's a very slow watch, but aims to suck the viewer in on its own terms, with its story focusing on three men who travel into a dangerous area known as "the Zone," as they believe that deep within, there's a place that's able to grant the wishes of any person who reaches it.

With its post-apocalyptic imagery and feel, it's possible to callStalkera science-fiction film, but it's a good deal more psychologically heavy and thematically dense than most examples within that genre. It's very bleak and unnerving, but hugely impressive when it comes to things like sound design, cinematography, and set design. It can be a challenging watch, but it's also certainly an essential one.
