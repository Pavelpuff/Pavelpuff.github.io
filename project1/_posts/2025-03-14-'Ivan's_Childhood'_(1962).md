## 5 - 'Ivan's Childhood' (1962)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.0/10

It's hard to believe that a film as good asIvan's Childhoodcan be a director's first proper feature film, but Tarkovsky was clearly a talented individual, as he made this film when he was only 30 years old. It's an intense andunflinching anti-war movieset during the Second World War, and chooses to focus on civilian life rather than the experience of soldiers.

It does this by centering on the title character, who's a young Soviet boy forced to survive on his own after his parents are both killed by invading German forces.It's beautifully shot and proves effectively tense and unnerving, managing to create a compelling war drama that never runs the risk of making war glamorous or entertaining to watch in any way.
