## 3 - 'Mirror' (1975)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.0/10

Mirroris a film that aims to tell one man's personal life story while also recounting key moments of Soviet history, all at once. It's told in flashback form, and utilizes this structure well, being about a man in his forties who's dying and recollecting the past - both his personal experience with life, and that of the Soviet nation.

As such, it's less about a direct narrative specifically, and more focused on being a film about the concept of memory, and the way the past can distort in one's mind as the years go on.It's a challenging watch, but its style and structure make it undeniably unique, and the creative cinematography employed throughout is also a highlight.
