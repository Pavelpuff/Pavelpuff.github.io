## 2 - 'Andrei Rublev' (1966)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.1/10

ThoughAndrei Rublevis technically definable as a biopic, it does far more than most movies that aim to capture a significant person's life story. Here, the subject isAndrei Rublev, who was a deeply spiritual painter who found and lost inspiration numerous times during his life, and witnessed events both terrible and great.

This was Tarkovsky's follow-up toIvan's Childhood, and for asgreat as that feature film debut was, it's hard to deny thatAndrei Rublevisn't a step-up technically.At about three hours long, it's also his lengthiest film, and arguably one of his most ambitious, making it all the more impressive how well it comes together, and how seamless it all feels despite the length.
