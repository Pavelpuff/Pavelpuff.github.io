## 10 - 'There Will Be No Leave Today' (1959)

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 6.5/10

There's not a great deal to say aboutThere Will Be No Leave Today. It was another student film of Tarkovsky's that has since become well-known thanks to the director's more legendary, later films. It runs for about three-quarters of an hour, and follows a group of soldiers removing explosives from WW2 that have been discovered by road workers.

In that way, it's sort of likeThe Hurt Locker, but much less dynamic and also made on a bare-bones budget.It's certainly interesting to watch and see what a young Tarkovsky was capable of(and it's better than most student films for sure), but ultimately won't appeal a great deal to viewers who aren't big fans of the filmmaker.
