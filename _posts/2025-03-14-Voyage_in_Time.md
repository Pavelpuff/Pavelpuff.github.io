## 9 - Voyage in Time

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 7.2/10

While scouting locations for his 1983 filmNostalghia, Andrei Tarkovsky also directedthis hour-long documentary-Voyage in Time- that serves, on the surface, as a making-of-documentary of sorts. It focuses on traveling to Italy for good places to shoot scenes, so in that way, doesn't exactly break down numerous elements of the film's production.

What it does offer is plenty of conversations about cinema in general, and is at its best when it shows Tarkovsky talking enthusiastically about the filmmakers who've inspired him.It's not always exciting, but it provides a good insight into a unique director's mind, and all the well-captured Italian scenery helps make things visually interesting, too.
