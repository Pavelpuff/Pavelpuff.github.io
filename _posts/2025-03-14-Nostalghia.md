## 6 - Nostalghia

**Rating:** IMDb Rating: 8.0/10

Nostalghiais a film that feels quite unusual and hard to describe, even by Andrei Tarkovsky's standards. On the surface, it follows a man who goes to Italy to study a composer from the 18th century, though finds himself homesick and puzzled by some of the unusual interactions he has with people during his travels.

It's a film that feels like it was deeply personal to Tarkovsky, which is probably the main thing. Open-minded viewers will be able to approach it on its own terms and hopefully interpret their own meanings from it, butit's certainly not the best Andrei Tarkovsky film to watch first, for anyone new to his brief - yet deep - body of work.
